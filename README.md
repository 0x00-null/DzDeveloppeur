This is a learning projet in which we are going to build a Q&amp;A Web application for Algerian Developers to gather all the community.

The life of a programmer can be isolating sometimes, as they are passionate about their work and tend to spend a lot of time coding. Their dedication is recognized and appreciated, but sometimes a little more communication is needed. This is where a Q&A platform for developers comes into play, as an excellent way to stay connected to a large support network of developers like ours at DZ DEVELOPPEURS.

Besides finding answers to some of the most difficult questions and staying on top of the game by helping others, they are a great way to relax, by talking on various topics with people who share the same interests.

Communities like StackOverflow, Toptal, Developers Forum or GitHub are just a few examples of great groups of developers where you can find resources and help.

But since we want to start building your own Q&A platform for Algerian developers. We just need to focus on a couple of key elements. Specifically, We need to start with researching what kind of members we want to attract which has been done already (Our DZ Developpeurs Community), then put together a comprehensive plan ahead of the launch. 

This project is released under a BSD-style license. See
